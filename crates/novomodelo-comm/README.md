# cobre-comm

Pluggable communication backend abstraction for the [Cobre](https://github.com/cobre-rs/cobre)
distributed solver ecosystem.

Defines the `Communicator` and `SharedMemoryProvider` traits that decouple
distributed computations from specific communication technologies. Two backends
are implemented: `LocalBackend`, a single-process no-op that is always
available and carries zero overhead, and `FerrompiBackend`, an MPI 4.x
implementation built on the [ferrompi](https://github.com/cobre-rs/ferrompi)
crate and enabled via the `mpi` Cargo feature. Available backends are
determined at **build time** by Cargo feature flags; the **active** backend is
then chosen at **runtime** by the explicit `BackendKind` the caller passes to
`create_communicator` — there is no environment-variable configuration
channel. All dispatch over the `Communicator` trait is static, so there is no
dynamic dispatch overhead on the hot path.

## When to Use

Depend on `cobre-comm` directly when you are writing a distributed algorithm
that needs collective communication (broadcast, reduce, scatter/gather) and
you want to test it locally without an MPI installation. Algorithm crates such
as `cobre-sddp` depend on this crate and accept a generic `Communicator`
parameter; you only need to depend here when adding a new algorithm crate or a
new backend.

## Key Types

- **`Communicator`** — the core trait for collective communication operations
  (broadcast, reduce, barrier) implemented by every backend
- **`LocalBackend`** — single-process no-op backend; always available, no
  external dependencies
- **`FerrompiBackend`** — MPI 4.x backend built on ferrompi; enabled with the
  `mpi` feature flag
- **`BackendKind`** — enum listing the available backends detected at compile
  time, used to select a backend via `create_communicator`
- **`SharedMemoryProvider`** — trait for intra-node memory-region allocation
  used by collocated processes

## Feature flags

| Feature         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mpi`           | off     | Enables `FerrompiBackend` and the `ferrompi` dependency (gates `dep:ferrompi`)                                                                       |
| `numa`          | off     | Extends `mpi` with NUMA-aware topology information from the ferrompi NUMA extension (implies `mpi`)                                                  |
| `shared-memory` | off     | Experimental intra-node shared-memory region API (`SharedMemoryProvider`, `SharedRegion`, `LocalCommunicator`, `HeapRegion`). Composable with `mpi`. |

Without any feature flags, only `LocalBackend`, the trait definitions, and the
type definitions are compiled; `create_communicator` returns `LocalBackend`
directly (not wrapped in an enum). The `shared-memory` feature is off by
default because its only implementation, `HeapRegion<T>`, is a heap-backed
placeholder — each rank allocates its own private `Vec<T>` with no memory
actually shared across processes; a true implementation on ferrompi's
`SharedWindow<T>` is deferred until a downstream consumer exists.

## Backend selection

`create_communicator(kind: BackendKind) -> Result<impl Communicator, BackendError>`
is the single runtime entry point for constructing the active communicator.
The `cobre` CLI maps `--comm-backend <auto|local|mpi>` (default `auto`) onto
this argument.

| `BackendKind` variant | Behavior                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Auto`                | Detect from the launch environment: MPI when an MPI launcher is present, else local                           |
| `Mpi`                 | Force the MPI backend; fails with `BackendError::BackendNotAvailable` if the `mpi` feature is not compiled in |
| `Local`               | Always use `LocalBackend`, even when MPI is available                                                         |

`Auto` checks for the presence of MPI launcher environment variables —
`PMI_RANK`, `PMI_SIZE`, `OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK`, `OMPI_COMM_WORLD_SIZE`,
`MPI_LOCALRANKID`, `SLURM_PROCID` — runtime facts set by
`mpiexec`/`mpirun`/`srun`, not a configuration channel. If any is set (and the
`mpi` feature is compiled in), the MPI backend is initialized; otherwise the
local backend is used. A run started under a launcher therefore distributes
without an explicit `--comm-backend mpi`.

When the `mpi` feature is compiled in, `create_communicator` returns the
`CommBackend` enum (`CommBackend::Mpi` / `CommBackend::Local`), which
implements `Communicator` (and, with `shared-memory`, `SharedMemoryProvider`)
by delegating each call to the active inner backend via a `match` — the
mandated enum-dispatch pattern for closed variant sets in Cobre, used because
`Communicator`'s generic methods make it non-object-safe (`Box<dyn
Communicator>` does not compile). Without the `mpi` feature,
`create_communicator` returns `LocalBackend` directly, with no wrapper enum.

## `FerrompiBackend`

`FerrompiBackend` wraps an [ferrompi](https://github.com/cobre-rs/ferrompi)
`Mpi` environment handle and an `MPI_COMM_WORLD` communicator. ferrompi is a
separate upstream repository providing safe MPI 4.x bindings for Rust —
type-safe wrappers around the collective operations (`allgatherv`,
`allreduce`, `broadcast`, `barrier`) with an RAII-managed
`MPI_Init_thread`/`MPI_Finalize` lifecycle.

Construction (`FerrompiBackend::new`) calls `MPI_Init_thread` with
`ThreadLevel::Funneled`, matching the Cobre execution model where only the
main thread issues MPI calls; rank/size/topology are cached at construction
so the hot path never re-queries them. When `FerrompiBackend` is dropped, the
RAII guard calls `MPI_Finalize` automatically — field declaration order is
load-bearing (Rust drops fields in reverse declaration order), so the `Mpi`
guard is declared first in the struct to be dropped _last_, after all derived
communicator handles.

`ferrompi::Mpi` is `!Send + !Sync` by design (a `PhantomData<*const ()>`
marker forces `MPI_Init`/`MPI_Finalize` onto the same thread). `FerrompiBackend`
carries `unsafe impl Send + Sync` on top of it: sound because the backend is
the sole owner of `Mpi` until drop (single ownership bars any other thread
from finalizing it), and the training loop's `ThreadLevel::Funneled` model
means every MPI call already originates from the same (main) thread that
constructed the backend. ferrompi enforces that model: below
`ThreadLevel::Serialized`, an MPI call from any other thread returns
`Error::ThreadLevelViolation` (mapped to `CommError::CollectiveFailed` with
code `-1`), and dropping the backend on another thread aborts the process.
All collective communication otherwise goes through
`ferrompi::Communicator`, an integer handle into a C-side table that is
already `Send + Sync`.

`FerrompiBackend::new()` requires an MPI runtime to be installed; if none is
found it returns `Err(BackendError::InitializationFailed)`.

## `Communicator` trait

Six methods: four fallible collectives, two infallible accessors, and one
non-returning abort.

| Method       | Signature                                                      | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allgatherv` | `(&self, send, recv, counts, displs) -> Result<(), CommError>` | Gather variable-length data from all ranks into all ranks                                       |
| `allreduce`  | `(&self, send, recv, op: ReduceOp) -> Result<(), CommError>`   | Element-wise reduction (sum, min, max, or bitwise-or) across all ranks                          |
| `broadcast`  | `(&self, buf, root: usize) -> Result<(), CommError>`           | Copy data from the root rank to all other ranks                                                 |
| `barrier`    | `(&self) -> Result<(), CommError>`                             | Block until all ranks have entered; pure synchronization                                        |
| `rank`       | `(&self) -> usize`                                             | This rank's index (`0..size()`); infallible, cached at construction                             |
| `size`       | `(&self) -> usize`                                             | Total number of ranks; infallible, cached at construction                                       |
| `abort`      | `(&self, error_code: i32) -> !`                                | Terminate every process (`MPI_Abort`, or `std::process::exit` on `LocalBackend`); never returns |

`Communicator` requires `Send + Sync`, all methods take `&self`, and callers
are responsible for serializing concurrent calls — the training loop ensures
that multiple threads never invoke the same collective simultaneously on the
same communicator instance. `rank()` and `size()` are safe to call
concurrently: their values are cached at construction time and never change.

This is the same monomorphization pattern used by `SolverInterface` in
[cobre-solver](../cobre-solver/README.md): callers parameterize a generic
function once and the compiler generates one concrete instantiation per
backend, so `LocalBackend`'s no-op implementations compile to zero
instructions after inlining.

## Error types

`CommError` is returned by all fallible `Communicator` and
`SharedMemoryProvider` methods:

| Variant               | When it occurs                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CollectiveFailed`    | An MPI collective operation failed at the library level (carries the MPI error code and a message) |
| `InvalidBufferSize`   | Buffer sizes provided to a collective are inconsistent                                             |
| `InvalidRoot`         | The `root` rank argument is out of range (`root >= size()`)                                        |
| `InvalidCommunicator` | The communicator is in an invalid state (e.g., MPI has been finalized)                             |
| `AllocationFailed`    | A shared-memory allocation request was rejected by the OS                                          |

`BackendError` is returned by `create_communicator` when the backend cannot be
selected or initialized:

| Variant                | When it occurs                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BackendNotAvailable`  | The requested backend is not compiled into this binary (e.g. `BackendKind::Mpi` without the `mpi` feature)    |
| `InvalidBackend`       | The requested backend name matches no known backend                                                           |
| `InitializationFailed` | The backend was selected but failed to initialize (e.g. MPI runtime not installed)                            |
| `MissingConfiguration` | Required environment variables for the selected backend are not set (reserved for the deferred `tcp` backend) |

## Deferred backends

Two additional backend slots are reserved but not yet implemented: **`tcp`** —
a TCP/IP coordinator pattern for distributed execution without an MPI
installation — and **`shm`** — a true POSIX/MPI-window shared-memory backend
to replace the current `HeapRegion` placeholder. Both would follow the same
`Communicator` / `SharedMemoryProvider` trait interfaces.

## Testing

```
cargo test -p cobre-comm
```

Runs all unit, integration, and doc-tests for the default (no-feature)
configuration — no MPI installation required. To include the MPI backend:

```
cargo test -p cobre-comm --features mpi
```

This requires an MPI runtime (`libmpich-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `mpich` on
Fedora or macOS Homebrew). CI runs tests without the `mpi` feature by default.

Integration coverage lives in `tests/local_conformance.rs` (the
backend-agnostic `Communicator` / `SharedMemoryProvider` / `LocalCommunicator`
contract, verified against `LocalBackend` through the public API only) and
`tests/factory_tests.rs` (`create_communicator` / `BackendKind` /
`available_backends` behavior across feature configurations).
