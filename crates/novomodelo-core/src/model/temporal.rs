//! Temporal domain types — stages, blocks, seasons, and stage transitions.
//!
//! This module defines the types that describe the time structure of a
//! multi-stage stochastic optimization problem: how the study horizon is
//! partitioned into stages, how stages are subdivided into load blocks,
//! how stages relate to seasonal patterns, and how a [`Transition`] represents
//! one stage-to-stage edge. [`super::horizon`] assembles transitions and nodes
//! into the horizon-wide topology.
//!
//! These are clarity-first data types following the dual-nature design
//! principle: they use `Vec<T>`, `String`, and `Option` for readability
//! and correctness. LP-related fields (variable indices, constraint counts,
//! coefficient arrays) belong to the performance layer in downstream solver crates.
//!
//! Source: `stages.json`. See `internal-structures.md` SS12.
