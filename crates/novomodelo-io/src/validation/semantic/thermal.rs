///    depth; parse-time also rejects it). Both `LeadStages`'s `K > n_stages`
///    and `LeadTime`'s `delta_hours` exceeding the summed study-stage
///    durations (strict `>`, so a delivery landing exactly on the final stage
///    is accepted) reject only a thermal whose lead reaches NO declared
///    post-study stage: a thermal whose extended lead reaches a post-study
///    stage — decided in-study (`carried`) or decided pre-study
///    (`fixed_post_study`, the full-anticipation regime) — legitimately
///    delivers post-horizon, so it is exempt, identically for either lead
///    mode. Whether the lead reaches a post-study stage is resolved once per
///    thermal by `classify_deliveries`'s `carried` and `fixed_post_study`
///    sets over the concatenated study + post-study calendar — computed
///    independently of the solver crate's resolver (`cobre-io` is upstream
///    and cannot depend on it) — and shared by both guards. A commissioning
///    window IS supported and composes with the lookahead; these checks
///    validate the LEAD itself, independent of any window.
/// 2. **Horizon-straddle guard** — see `check_no_straddling_commitment_window`:
///    a `past_anticipated_commitments` window whose `[start_date, end_date)`
///    span crosses the study horizon end (`start_date < horizon_end &&
///    end_date > horizon_end`) is rejected, since it is unrepresentable by
///    either (3)'s study-side bijection or `check_post_study_stages`'s
///    post-study tiling and today silently prices its post-horizon tail at
///    zero. A window ending exactly at, or starting exactly at, the horizon is
///    accepted (purely in-study / purely post-study — two semantically
///    distinct coverages, so a straddling declaration must be split in two).
///    Gates (3)-(5) for the offending plant, since a straddling window's
///    coverage numbers are meaningless.
/// 3. **Past-commitments registry bijection** with
///    `ic.past_anticipated_commitments`: each anticipated thermal has at least
///    one commitment window, each window references an anticipated thermal, and
///    the plant's windows tile its leading `lead_delivery_stage_count` delivery
///    stages exactly (coverage `1.0`, no gap, no overlap, none beyond the
///    horizon) via the shared [`StageCalendar`] resolver — a hard gate, no
///    fallback (the "Pre-study anticipated commitments: calendar-derived
///    coverage" contract).
