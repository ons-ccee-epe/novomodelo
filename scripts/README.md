# `scripts/`

Helper scripts for Cobre, grouped by role.

- **`ci/`** — quality gates and the advisory report. Run in CI
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and some also from the `pre-commit` hook and from
  Rust integration tests. The shell gates locate the repo root from their own
  path, so they run from anywhere; the Python gates default to the current
  directory (pass `--root` to override).
- **`gen/`** — generators for release/build artifacts.
- **`rebrand/`** — the fork's rename tool. `rebrand.py paths|tokens|check`
  moves paths, rewrites contents and guards against leftovers, all driven by
  the one name map `map.toml`; `test_rebrand.py` covers it.
- **`pre-commit`** — the git pre-commit hook. Install with
  `ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
- **`loc-stats.sh`** — refreshable reporting tool (not a CI gate): Rust line
  counts split into production vs test, per crate and global, plus test-function
  counts. `--nextest` adds the runtime test count, `--worktree`/`--csv` vary the
  source and output format.

## `ci/` — quality gates

Most gates fail the build on violation; the ones marked _advisory_ never fail.
The shared `cfg(test)`-boundary helpers live in `ci/lib/comment_scan.sh` (it is
sourced, not executed; running it directly self-checks that the holdout gates
still carry the canonical boundary regex).

| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check-doc-paths.sh`                 | Repo-relative paths in README/CONTRIBUTING/CLAUDE.md resolve against the tree.                             |
| `check_doc_voice.py`                 | No promotional voice or unpinned "typical" numbers in prose (doc-integrity §5/§2).                         |
| `check-doc-placeholders.sh`          | No placeholder text (TODO/TBD/…) in shipped docs.                                                          |
| `check-docs-examples.sh`             | A fresh `init`→`run` matches the expected output structure (needs the release binary; `--build`).          |
| `check-no-plan-leaks.sh`             | No plan-structure tokens (`Epic`/`ticket`/…) in shipped artifacts.                                         |
| `check-comment-refs.sh`              | No un-rottable `file.rs:NNN`-style references in shipped comments.                                         |
| `check-comment-line-refs.sh`         | No drift-prone line references in shipped comments and stubs.                                              |
| `check-comment-banners.sh`           | Flags in-function banner-divider comments (advisory).                                                      |
| `check-comment-bloat.sh`             | Ranks comment-bloat candidates (advisory; also surfaced by `quality-report.sh`).                           |
| `check-allow-rationale.sh`           | Every `#[allow]` carries a `// Rationale:` (E4; diff-scoped via `BASE_REF`).                               |
| `check-infra-genericity.sh`          | No algorithm-specific vocabulary in the infrastructure crates.                                             |
| `check-cut-selection-determinism.sh` | Cut-selection code stays declaration-order deterministic.                                                  |
| `check_python_parity.py`             | Both write paths call the same set of `cobre_io` / `cobre_sddp::policy::orchestration` writers, and each phase writer calls `write_success_marker` as its last write. |
| `check_schemas.sh`                   | Exported JSON schemas match the source types (needs the release binary; `--build`).                        |
| `quality-report.sh`                  | Advisory code-quality hotspot report; also runs the comment-bloat advisory.                                |
| `lib/comment_scan.sh`                | Shared `cfg(test)`-boundary helpers, sourced by the comment gates.                                         |
| `allow-rationale-allowlist.txt`      | Allowlist consumed by `check-allow-rationale.sh`.                                                          |
