# check-infra-genericity.sh — Infrastructure crate genericity gate.
#
# Scans the five infrastructure crates for algorithm-specific vocabulary that
# must not appear in their production source code:
#
#   novomodelo-core, novomodelo-io, novomodelo-solver, novomodelo-stochastic, novomodelo-comm
#
# Patterns flagged (word-boundary anchored to avoid false positives on
# identifiers like "execution", "cuts_active", "cutting_edge"):
#
#   \bSddp\b | \bsddp\b | \bSDDP\b — SDDP algorithm references
#   \bBenders\b             — Benders decomposition references
#   \bCut\b | \bcut\b      — standalone "cut" / "Cut" (word boundary)
#   cut pool                — phrase: cut pool
#   cutting-plane           — phrase: cutting-plane
#   cutting\.plane          — phrase: cutting.plane
#   outer approximation     — phrase: outer approximation
#   CutSync\w*             — CutSync type names
#   CutSelection\w*        — CutSelection type names
#   MetadataCuts\b         — MetadataCuts type name
#
# Exclusions:
#
#   1. Files whose name contains "test" (e.g., integration test files, test
#      helper files named *_test.rs or test_*.rs).
#   2. Inline #[cfg(test)] blocks within production files: once a line matching
#      `#[cfg(test)]` is seen, all subsequent lines until end-of-file are
#      considered test scope and skipped. This handles the common Rust pattern
#      where the test module sits at the bottom of a production file.
#
# Known limitation: the #[cfg(test)] exclusion assumes the test module is a
# tail block. Rust files with mid-file test modules separated by production
# code after them would incorrectly skip that trailing production code. In
# practice, all novomodelo infra files follow the tail-block convention.
#
# Explicitly excluded files:
#
#   None. The output/policy/ files formerly sat here pending a
#   value-function-artifact format-version bump; that bump landed (the
#   FlatBuffers table speaks affine-piece vocabulary and the standalone-"cut"
#   identifiers are gone), so the exemption is retired and the directory module
#   is scanned like every other infra source file.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — No violations found.
#   1 — One or more violations found (details printed to stdout).
#
# Implementation note on \b word boundaries:
#   This script uses `grep -E` for all pattern matching. POSIX/GNU awk silently
#   treats `\b` as a backspace character when the pattern is supplied via
#   `-v pat=`, so awk-based matching was unreliable. grep -E correctly supports
#   \b word-boundary anchors. awk is retained only for structural work
#   (truncating files at the #[cfg(test)] boundary and emitting FILE:LINE:
#   prefixes); all regex matching goes through grep -E.
