`VariableRef` (`novomodelo-core`) and `BroadcastComputedParameter` (`novomodelo-io`) are
postcard-encoded enums with no version byte: postcard serializes a variant as
its positional index, so inserting a variant mid-enum silently shifts every
later discriminant and reinterprets previously serialized values as the wrong
variant. Both enums are therefore append-only — a new variant is added at the
tail only — and each tail assignment is guarded by a first-byte discriminant
pin plus a full encode → decode → equality round-trip.

## Tail assignments

| Variant                             | Enum                         | Postcard discriminant | Guarding test(s)                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HydroUsefulVolumeInitial`           | `VariableRef`                 | `0x18`                  | `test_variable_ref_postcard_discriminant_pin` (pin); `hydro_useful_volume_initial_postcard_roundtrip` (round-trip)  |
| `HydroUsefulVolumeFinal`             | `VariableRef`                 | `0x19`                  | `test_variable_ref_postcard_discriminant_pin` (pin); `hydro_useful_volume_final_postcard_roundtrip` (round-trip)    |
| `IntegratedEquivalentProductivity`   | `BroadcastComputedParameter`  | `0x07`                  | `broadcast_computed_parameter_postcard_discriminant_pin` (pin); `broadcast_computed_parameter_integrated_tags_round_trip` (round-trip) |
| `IntegratedAccumulatedProductivity`  | `BroadcastComputedParameter`  | `0x08`                  | `broadcast_computed_parameter_postcard_discriminant_pin` (pin); `broadcast_computed_parameter_integrated_tags_round_trip` (round-trip) |
| `MaxStoredEnergy`                    | `BroadcastComputedParameter`  | `0x09`                  | `broadcast_computed_parameter_postcard_discriminant_pin` (pin); `broadcast_computed_parameter_max_stored_energy_round_trip` (round-trip) |

## Why no reject-old-version test applies

A dual-owned wire format normally carries both a round-trip test and a
reject-old-version test (a stale version byte must fail decoding rather than
silently corrupt). Neither obligation is missing here — it does not apply, for
two reasons specific to these two enums:

- **No version byte to reject on.** Postcard encodes an enum variant purely as
  its positional index; there is no separate version field in the payload for
  a decoder to compare against. A "feed a stale version byte, assert an error"
  test has nothing to assert against — the discriminant pin already covers the
  failure mode a version byte would guard (a shifted index reinterpreting a
  byte as the wrong variant).
- **Same-version-ranks-only, never persisted.** `VariableRef` values travel
  inside the in-process constraint model built and consumed within one solver
  build. `BroadcastComputedParameter` values travel only between MPI ranks of
  a single running solve, broadcast from the same binary that constructed
  them. Neither payload is written to disk and read back by a possibly older
  or newer build, so there is no cross-version compatibility surface to test.

A future reader should not file a "missing reject-test" finding against either
enum on this basis; the discriminant pin plus the full round-trip is the
complete discipline for an append-only, non-versioned, non-persisted wire
enum.

## How to append a new variant

Add the variant at the enum's tail — never mid-enum. Add a first-byte
discriminant-pin assertion for the new variant (extending the enum's existing
pin test) and a full encode → decode → `assert_eq!` round-trip test covering
every field combination the variant's shape allows. Never insert a variant
before an existing one: doing so shifts every later discriminant and silently
reinterprets already-serialized values as the wrong variant.

## Policy checkpoint manifest fields (FlatBuffers)

The policy checkpoint's `manifest.bin` is a FlatBuffers `CheckpointManifest`
table. `crates/novomodelo-io/schemas/policy.fbs` is the canonical schema, and its
header owns the wire-level conventions, the burned slots and every field id
assigned before this register. The hand-rolled codec in
`crates/novomodelo-io/src/output/policy/codec.rs` addresses each field by a vtable
slot constant, `4 + 2 * id`. A new manifest field follows these rules:

- It takes the next explicit `id` at the table's end and never reuses a
  `deprecated` slot.
- Its codec slot constant changes together with `policy.fbs`.
- A buffer without the field decodes to the field's empty or `None` value,
  never to an error.
- The flatc conformance test
  (`crates/novomodelo-io/tests/flatbuffers_schema_conformance.rs`, feature
  `flatc-conformance`) guards both directions: the hand-rolled buffer read by
  `flatc`, and a `flatc`-built buffer read by the hand-rolled reader.
- An additive field needs no `FORMAT_VERSION` step inside a release. The policy
  load gate refuses any checkpoint whose `software`/`software_version` differ
  from the running build's, so every checkpoint a run loads was written by that
  same build.

### Field assignments

| Field                 | Table                | `id` | Codec slot | Guarding test(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lower_bound_history` | `CheckpointManifest` | 21   | 46         | `checkpoint_manifest_round_trip` (flatc, both directions); `checkpoint_manifest_round_trips_the_lower_bound_history_bitwise` (round-trip); `checkpoint_manifest_without_the_lower_bound_history_reads_an_empty_series` (absent field) |
