# Design docs

Design specifications, decision records, and proposals for the Novomodelo workspace.
Each doc carries a **status** at its top; this index is the map. Status vocabulary:

- **Live spec** — documents shipped behavior. The cited symbols exist in the tree;
  verify them before acting, but the described behavior is real.
- **Decision record** — a settled evaluation: what was measured, what was decided,
  and what not to re-attempt. Includes pre-registered experiments where noted.
- **Living register** — tracks the workspace's current reserved/deferred state; each
  entry is self-guarding and re-derived against the live tree.
- **Proposal** — a target design that is **not yet implemented**. Snapshot figures in
  a proposal are calibration-time context, not standing claims.
- **Design brief** — a precise problem statement and goal that precedes a design:
  the situation, the confirmed constraints, and what a solution must achieve. It
  proposes no solution; the design that answers it is written separately.

## Maintenance convention

A proposal that ships is **deleted from this directory** once its content lands in
its authoritative home (a `.claude/rules/*` rule, a code contract, an
`ARCHITECTURE.md` section) — git history preserves the original. This keeps
`docs/design/` a set of live references, not an archive of superseded plans. When a
proposal is implemented, fold any durable rationale into the home it describes, then
remove the doc.
